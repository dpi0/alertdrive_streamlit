# AlertDrive
*A Deep-Learning Based Driver Alertness Evaluation*

## 📕About this App
In an era where road safety is of paramount importance, driver attentiveness plays a vital role in preventing accidents and safeguarding lives. With a mission to enhance road safety and reduce the risks associated with drowsy driving, welcome AlertDrive.

## 🚀Necessity
The necessity of this project stems from the dire consequences of driver inattention on road safety. Distractions, fatigue, and other factors can significantly impair a driver's ability to stay alert, increasing the likelihood of accidents.

By developing a comprehensive driver monitoring system, we can proactively identify signs of inattentiveness and provide drivers with real-time feedback and alerts, helping them maintain focus on the road.

Furthermore, the integration of age verification functionality ensures that the system is used responsibly, preventing underage individuals from accessing the monitoring system.

## 🤔How to use this app?

**Live Video Analysis**: Click on the "Start" button to initiate the live video feed from your camera system. This feature will continuously monitor your facial expressions and head position to provide real-time feedback on your level of attentiveness while driving.

It will specifically detect any instances where you may doze off or divert your attention away from the road.

**Session Control**: You have the flexibility to stop the monitoring session at any time. If you choose to end the session, you will be prompted to either receive a detailed report of your session via email or simply log out if you prefer not to receive the report.
